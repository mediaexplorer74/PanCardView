# PanCardView

This is my fork of [CardView](https://github.com/AndreiMisiukevich/CardView) project
(Pan)CardView is very cool project that realized CoverFlow, CoverCube and other amazing, special, visual effects! :)

## My 2 cents

- Original CardView solution explored / solution refactored (Tizen/GTK/MacOs "targets" deleted)
- UWP "target" fixed a little =)

## Status
- .NET Standard 2.0 now used (1.4 in my plans) 
- I have a dream to run this "super effects" on my old sweet Lumia 950! :)
